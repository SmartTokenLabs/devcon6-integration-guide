# DevCon6 | Permissionless Perks

This repository is the hub to learn about integration with DevCon6 Permissionless Perks.

Permissionless Perks is built on top of TokenScript which is a framework which improves functionality, security and 
usability of blockchain tokens. It creates a layer between a blockchain and user devices, adding information, 
rules and functionalities both on-chain and off=chain.

In this repo you will find examples for token-negotiator integration and server or blockchain verification.

## What's this all about

DevCon6 has gone away with traditional corporate sponsorship and moved towards a system where anyone can sponsor and
get exposure for their brand by targeting conference attendees with special “perks”.
These perks can be anything including discounts, freebies, exclusive events, content & services.

Ticket ownership can be easily verified on or off-chain. This benefits both users & sponsors.
Users benefit by being able to quickly access perks whilst maintaining privacy.
Sponsors benefit from being able to permissionessly entice conference attendees with their offer.
This enables sponsors to reach new customers, build brand trust, gain insights or just make new friends!
